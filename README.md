# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using Logistic Regression. Fraud detection is crucial for financial institutions to minimize losses and protect customers. The aim is to build a robust model that can effectively distinguish between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. This dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for 0.172% of all transactions.

## Installation
To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
## Usage
Data Preprocessing: The first step is to preprocess the data, including handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Training the Model: Train the Logistic Regression model using the preprocessed data.

Evaluating the Model: Evaluate the model's performance using the accuracy metric.

Prediction: Use the trained model to predict whether new transactions are fraudulent or not.

## Model
The project uses Logistic Regression for fraud detection. Logistic Regression is a simple yet effective model for binary classification problems, which makes it suitable for this task.

## Evaluation
The model is evaluated using the following metric:

Accuracy: The proportion of correctly identified transactions (both fraudulent and legitimate).
## Results
The results section includes a summary of the Logistic Regression model's performance, highlighting the accuracy achieved on the test set. Visualizations such as the confusion matrix may be provided to aid in understanding the model's performance.
